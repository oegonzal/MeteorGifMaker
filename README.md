Meteor Gifmaker
======

Instructions:
======

1. Make sure you have Meteor installed and can run it on your terminal. You can get Meteor at https://www.meteor.com/developers
2. From your terminal navigate to the project's root directory, MeteorGifMaker
3. Once there, enter command 'meteor' and hit enter
4. On a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ (IMPORTANT: make sure to open in http://localhost:3000/ and not in a karma debug page, otherwise app will not work!)
5. You should be good to go to try out the Meteor web app.

Testing
======

When you navigate to http://localhost:3000/ you will notice a velocity tool will appear along side the project on the right side of the screen. Wait a few moments while the tool automates the tests and shows tests results.

If you wish to go straight to the app simply hit the 'x' icon on the top right side of the test modal and the modal will slide out. (In case you want to open it again, there will be a circle icon on the top right side. Hit this to open velocity test tools again)

Usage
======

The application is simple yet amazingly entertaining!! On the top you will see a drag and drop section where you can drag images or click to select images from file directory. You can select up to 5 images.
Once that is complete, you have the option to enter how many milliseconds to delay between pictures as the gif cycles through the picture selection (default is 750 ms). Click the 'Create GIF' button to make your GIF. Click the GIF to download it. And if you want to create another one, just hit the 'Reset' button and make another amazing GIF!
